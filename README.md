# dailyMath
An application developed using Java Swing for working on and improving skills in arithmetic.

The application is currently in an early prototype, where a user can pick their operation and the difficulty of the problems that they will receive.
The actual problems currently run in the console. The next update will change this so the problems run in the application, rather than outside of it.
