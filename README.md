# dailyMath
An application developed using Java Swing for working on and improving skills in arithmetic. It has a SQLite database attatched to it to record high scores (READ BELOW).

Currently, this application allows the user to pick between addition, subtraction and multiplication. It also allows for an easy mode, which consists of only one-digit numbers, and a normal mode, which includes both one and two digit numbers.

**UPDATE 7/24/2020**
**A leaderboard has been implemented for testing purposes, but is in a very early state. It logs the user's score, the difficulty they played on, and their name (which can be changed on the start screen.) The "High Scores" button on the selection screen will output the top 10 scores for addition, the user's name and the mode they played on. Currently, the output goes directly to the console, but I hope to have this fixed in an update soon. I will also add leaderboards for other modes as well. This current leaderboard serves more as a test and a proof of it adding and displaying data.
The only other change in this update is the slight overhaul of the UI on the selection screen, including making it slightly larger and moving some buttons around.**

In future updates, I hope to add the following:
- A leaderboard that keeps track of top scores in each mode. **IN PROGRESS**
- A timed mode for users to try to score as many points in a given amount of time. Currently, the application runs until the user has reached 20 questions (10 for easy addition).
- An untimed mode that will continue until the user decides to exit.
- And more...
