# dailyMath
An application developed using Java Swing for working on and improving skills in arithmetic.

Currently, this application allows the user to pick between addition, subtraction and multiplication. It also allows for an easy mode, which consists of only one-digit numbers, and a normal mode, which includes both one and two digit numbers.  

In future updates, I hope to add the following:
- A timed mode for users to try to score as many points in a given amount of time. Currently, the application runs until the user has reached 20 questions (10 for easy addition).
- A leaderboard that keeps track of top scores in each mode.
- An untimed mode that will continue until the user decides to exit.
- And more...
